## Description

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. The game starts with an empty gallows, and players must guess letters one by one. Each incorrect guess results in the gradual drawing of a hangman figure, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends.
